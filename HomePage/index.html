            <div class='intro'>Ada Lovelace has inspired our school but also a lot of computer engineers but above all many computer scientists. She is indeed at the origin of the first algorithm, the one that will inspire Alan Turing when designing the computer. What is the story of this woman whose works we too often forget?</div>

    <div class="frame-info-white-background">
        <div class="frame-info-white">
            <p>In 1815, Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabelle - Annabella - Milbanke welcomed the birth of Augusta Ada Byron. Ada is therefore the daughter of a tortured and temperamental poet and a passionate about mathematics, nicknamed the “Princess of Parallelograms”.

    <!-- INFO 2 -->
    <div class="frame-info-gray-background">
        <div class="frame-info-gray">
            <p>A few months after her birth, Ada's parents separated. Lord Byron has indeed never recovered from his separation with his first love, his half-sister Augusta Leigh and subjects his wife to all his moods. By leaving her husband, Annabella then decides that her daughter will no longer be called Augusta, like Lord Byron's lover, but Ada.</p>

    <!-- INFO 3 -->
    <div class="frame-info-white-background">
        <div class="frame-info-white">
            <p>Ada suffered throughout her childhood from the absence of her father, but also that of her unloving mother. This initiates him to mathematics in order to keep him away from all poetry and other romantic arts which could manifest in her as much madness as in her father. It is therefore in the sciences that Ada takes refuge to forget the abandonment of her parents. It benefits from the supervision of illustrious professors, which is very rare at a time when scientific subjects were mainly taught to boys.</p>

    <div class="frame-info-gray-background">
        <div class="frame-info-gray">
            <p>Annabella's strategy is so successful that Ada, seduced by mathematics, runs away with her tutor, Charles Babbage, at the age of 16. This flight is ultimately unsuccessful: Ada returns home and marries William King, Earl of Lovelace. Having become the mother of three children, which weakens her already weak health, Ada reluctantly takes time away from her mathematical studies.</p>
