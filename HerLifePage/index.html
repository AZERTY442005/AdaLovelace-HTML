            <p>Ada Lovelace died in 1852 at the age of 36. It is relatively unknown to the general public, yet it has left its name to many entities and to a programming language - Ada - designed by the US Department of Defense between 1977 and 1983. This object language is used in many advanced technologies such as aerospace, aeronautics, rail transport… Ada Lovelace was a visionary. His interpretation of the Machine as a tool for interpreting and manipulating much more than numbers inspired Alan Turing's work on a universal calculator. In summary, we owe a lot to this lady and we are proud to bear her name! Happy Ada Lovelace Day!</p>
